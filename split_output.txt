**INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT**

The room is dimly lit, with only a faint moonlight peeking through the curtains. EMILY, a young woman in her early 20s, lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Her phone suddenly rings, breaking the silence. She hesitates, then answers.

**EMILY**  
(nervously)  
Hello?

A faint, whispery voice responds.

**VOICE ON PHONE**  
(whispering)  
Emily... my darling...

Emily's eyes widen in shock as she recognizes the voice.

**EMILY**  
(terrified)  
M-Mom?

The voice on the phone grows louder, but still whispery.

**VOICE ON PHONE**  
(whispering)  
I'm still with you, Emily. I've always been with you.

Emily's hands start to shake as she sits up in bed.

**EMILY**  
(panicked)  
But... but you're gone. You've been gone for years.

**VOICE ON PHONE**  
(whispering)  
I know, baby. But I've been waiting for you. I've been waiting for you to come visit me.

Suddenly, the phone call drops. Emily is left staring at her phone in horror.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT**

Emily stands in front of her mother's grave, the moon casting an eerie glow. She looks down at the headstone, then back at her phone.

**EMILY**  
(whispering)  
Mom?

As she speaks, the wind picks up, and the trees start to creak. Emily's eyes widen as she hears her mother's whispery voice again, this time coming from the grave.

**VOICE FROM GRAVE**  
(whispering)  
I'm still with you, Emily. Come closer.

Emily takes a step back, terrified. The voice grows louder, more urgent.

**VOICE FROM GRAVE**  
(whispering)  
Come closer, Emily. I want to show you something.

Emily's feet seem rooted to the spot. The voice grows louder, more menacing.

**VOICE FROM GRAVE**  
(whispering)  
You should have visited me sooner, Emily.

As the voice fades away, Emily turns to run. But it's too late. The ground gives way beneath her, and she falls into the grave.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT**

The camera pans over the grave, now empty except for Emily's phone, lying on the dirt. The screen flickers to life, displaying a text message.

**INSERT PHONE SCREEN: "I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU."**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** *"Some bonds go beyond the grave."*

*End.*
