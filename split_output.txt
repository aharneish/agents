**INT. LABORATORY - DAY**

We see a futuristic laboratory filled with advanced technology. DR. RYAN, mid-30s, a brilliant but reclusive scientist, works tirelessly at a computer terminal. He's surrounded by holographic screens displaying brain wave patterns and neural connections.

**DR. RYAN**  
(to himself)  
If I can just crack the encryption...

Suddenly, a holographic screen flickers to life, displaying a memory file labeled "CLASSIFIED."

**DR. RYAN**  
(excited)  
Yes! I did it!

He plugs in a neural interface and downloads the memory into his mind.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (MEMORY)**

Dr. Ryan experiences the memory as if he's living it. He sees a group of shadowy figures discussing a sinister plot.

**SHADOWY FIGURE 1**  
(whispers)  
The project is ready. We can control the population.

**SHADOWY FIGURE 2**  
(nodding)  
And with the memory trade, we can erase any evidence.

Dr. Ryan's eyes widen as he realizes the implications.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. LABORATORY - DAY**

Dr. Ryan removes the neural interface, looking shaken.

**DR. RYAN**  
(whispers)  
What have I stumbled upon?

He tries to access the memory file again, but it's been deleted.

**DR. RYAN**  
(determined)  
I need to find out more.

He starts searching through the lab's database, but the system alerts him that he's being monitored.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SECURITY ROOM - DAY**

A group of agents, led by AGENT JENKINS, watch Dr. Ryan on a surveillance screen.

**AGENT JENKINS**  
(to her team)  
We have a problem. Dr. Ryan has accessed a classified memory.

**AGENT 2**  
(concerned)  
What do we do?

**AGENT JENKINS**  
(coldly)  
We take care of him. Permanently.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. LABORATORY - DAY**

Dr. Ryan realizes he's in danger. He grabs a small device and activates it.

**DR. RYAN**  
(determined)  
I won't let you erase me.

The device emits a high-pitched frequency, disrupting the lab's security systems.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. LABORATORY - DAY**

Dr. Ryan escapes the lab, looking over his shoulder as the agents close in.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** *"Some memories are better left forgotten."*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. CITY STREET - DAY**

Dr. Ryan walks away from the lab, determined to uncover the truth.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

*End.*
