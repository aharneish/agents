**INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**

The room is dimly lit. A ticking clock fills the silence. LUCY, mid-20s, sits on the couch, scrolling through her phone. Suddenly, her phone buzzes with a notification. She squints at the screen.

**INSERT PHONE SCREEN: "UNKNOWN CALLER"**

Lucy hesitates but answers.

**LUCY**  
(whispers)  
Hello?

No response. Just faint, heavy breathing. Lucyâ€™s heartbeat quickens.

**LUCY**  
Who is this?

The breathing stops. A *KNOCK* on the front door makes her jump. She stares at the door, frozen.

**CLOSE-UP: DOORKNOB slowly turning.**

Lucy grabs a nearby vase, creeping toward the door. She holds her breath. The doorknob stops.

*Silence.*

Suddenly, her phone BUZZES again. She glances at it.

**INSERT PHONE SCREEN: "I'M ALREADY INSIDE."**

Lucy gasps, spinning around to see the SHADOW of a figure behind her.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**CUT TO: SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS.**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** *"Not all visitors knock."*

---  
*End.*
